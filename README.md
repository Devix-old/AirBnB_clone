# AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project's command interpreter README. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and how to use the command interpreter effectively.

## Background Context

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! Before you dive into the details, it's essential to familiarize yourself with the [AirBnB concept page](#) (link to your concept page). This project is the first step towards building a full web application - the AirBnB clone. It is a crucial foundation for subsequent projects involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API integration, and front-end development.

### Project Objectives

In this initial step, you will accomplish the following key objectives:

1. **BaseModel Class**: Implement a parent class called `BaseModel` responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing instances of your future objects.

2. **Serialization Flow**: Create a simple flow for serialization/deserialization, which includes converting instances to dictionaries, dictionaries to JSON strings, and JSON strings to files.

3. **AirBnB Object Classes**: Develop classes for various AirBnB objects such as User, State, City, Place, etc., all of which inherit from the `BaseModel` class.

4. **Storage Engine**: Build the first abstracted storage engine of the project - File storage, which allows you to store and retrieve object data.

5. **Unit Testing**: Create comprehensive unit tests to validate all your classes and the storage engine's functionality.

### What is a Command Interpreter?

Think of the Command Interpreter as a simplified version of a shell. Its primary purpose in this project is to help you manage AirBnB objects efficiently. You can use it to:

- Create new objects (e.g., User, Place).
- Retrieve objects from various sources, such as files or databases.
- Perform operations on objects, like counting or computing statistics.
- Update attributes of existing objects.
- Delete objects when needed.

### Resources

To successfully complete this project, you should familiarize yourself with the following resources:

- [cmd module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html)
- [cmd module in depth](https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/library/cmd.html)
- [Python packages concept page](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- [uuid module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html)
- [datetime module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
- [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [args and kwargs in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists)
- [Python test cheatsheet](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/)

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external resources:

#### General Knowledge

- How to create a Python package.
- Creating a command interpreter in Python using the `cmd` module.
- Understanding unit testing and implementing it in a large project.
- Serializing and deserializing a class.
- Reading and writing JSON files.
- Managing datetime in Python.
- Understanding UUID (Universally Unique Identifier).
- Using `*args` and `**kwargs` in Python functions.
- Handling named arguments in a function.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/yourprojectrepository).

2. Install the required dependencies specified in the project's `requirements.txt` file.

3. Run the command interpreter by executing the main script (e.g., `airbnb.py`).

4. Start using the command interpreter to create, manage, and interact with AirBnB objects.

## Usage

Here's a brief overview of how to use the command interpreter:

1. Launch the command interpreter by running the main script (e.g., `airbnb.py`) in your terminal.

2. Use the provided commands and syntax to create, retrieve, update, and delete AirBnB objects.

3. Refer to the project documentation and comments within the code for detailed information on available commands and their usage.
